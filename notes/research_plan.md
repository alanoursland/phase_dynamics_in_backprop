# Research Plan: Evaluating the Vadam Optimizer for Improved Performance with Non-Monotonic Activations

## 1. Introduction
The **Vadam optimizer**, a modification of the standard **Adam optimizer**, incorporates **adaptive momentum decay** and **gradient clipping** to enhance stability and performance with **non-monotonic activation functions** like **Absolute Value (Abs)** and **Square**.
